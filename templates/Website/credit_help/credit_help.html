                            <p>
                                Credit Repair is the process of identifying and resolving disputed credit errors, inaccuracies and misinformation reported on your credit history.
                                Strategically it is the reshaping of an individual’s credit profile with an aim to optimize the credit scores.

                                A professional credit repair lawfully helps you repair your credit report by
                                •	Identifying errors, disputes, inaccurate entries, and negative items on your major credit reports
                                •	Managing and following a systematic dispute process to remove these items
                                •	Designing and suggesting the implementation of a comprehensive credit management plan to increase your score
                                •	Providing education on maintenance of high credit score
                                •	Helping you improve your learning curve about basic and advanced credit reporting and credit management skills.

                                If you are in a financial condition where your poor credit score is keeping you away from being qualified for car loans, mortgages, or any other form of credit lines, then credit repair is the best solution to your problem.
                                Even if you do qualify for a credit or loan product, a low credit score on your report will make you end up with very high-interest rates.
                                On top of this, your risky credit standing will make you pay more as financial costs and charges.
                                Opting for professional credit repair services will enable you to not just qualify for good loans and mortgages but will also reduce your interest rates and cost of funds significantly.

                            <p>
                                No one can answer this question specifically. Every credit report is different from the other. When going through the process of dispute, the credit reporting agency might respond with varying times.
                                Depending on the item you are resolving and the circumstances, the credit repair time may range from 30 – 45 days.
                                If there are multiple errors, it may take as long as six months to improve your score significantly.
